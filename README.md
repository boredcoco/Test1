# Test1
This game is made using 2021.3.9 as I do not have the space to download another version of Unity of my laptop

## 3d
The concept of the game revolves around a geometric terrain (500 x 500), with a couple of platforms that the player can jump on and collect "coins". All assets in the 3D game are in black and white. The terrain is painted in black and platforms and enemies are coloured white. The distinction between colours draws attention to platforms and enemies.

### Coins
Coins are translucent circles shown below. Collecting them will increase the score by 1. The coins will disappear after being collected.

### Enemy cubes
Enemy cubes are white cubes that move back and forth within a fixed distance, colliding into them will result in the loss of player health. When a player dies, they will be redirected to the main menu directly, where they can choose a game. Generally this game does not end until the player dies, hence there is no way to enter the main menu from here unless the player dies.
